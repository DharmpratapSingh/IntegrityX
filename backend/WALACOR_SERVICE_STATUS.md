# 🔍 WALACOR SERVICE CONNECTION STATUS

## ⚠️ **Current Status: LOCAL SIMULATION MODE**

The real Walacor EC2 service is **NOT connected**. Your system is running in **local blockchain simulation mode** instead.

---

## 📊 **What's Happening:**

### ❌ **Real Walacor EC2:**
```
Status: UNREACHABLE
Error: "Walacor API is unreachable (connection timeout)"
Host: 13.220.225.175:443
```

### ✅ **Fallback Mode Active:**
```
Status: OPERATIONAL
Mode: Local Blockchain Simulation (Production Mode)
Function: Fully functional for development/testing
```

---

## 🔄 **What This Means:**

### **For Your App:**
✅ **Everything still works!**
- Document uploads: ✅ Working
- Blockchain sealing: ✅ Simulated locally
- Hash generation: ✅ Working
- Verification: ✅ Working
- All features: ✅ Functional

### **What's Different:**
⚠️ **Not using real blockchain**
- Using local simulation instead of AWS EC2
- Hashes are generated locally
- Blockchain transactions are simulated
- Still cryptographically secure, just not on remote server

---

## 🎯 **Why Is EC2 Unreachable?**

**Possible Reasons:**
1. **EC2 Instance is Down/Stopped**
   - The AWS server at `13.220.225.175` might be stopped
   - Could be for cost savings or maintenance

2. **Network/Firewall Issues**
   - Your network might be blocking the connection
   - AWS security groups might have restrictions

3. **Service Not Running**
   - The Walacor service on EC2 might not be started
   - Could be a configuration issue

4. **Intentional Development Mode**
   - System designed to work offline
   - Local simulation for testing

## 🛠️ **How to Connect to Real Walacor EC2:**

### **Option 1: Start the EC2 Instance**
```bash
# If you have AWS access:
aws ec2 start-instances --instance-ids <your-instance-id>

# Then restart your backend
```

### **Option 2: Check EC2 Status**
```bash
# Verify the instance is running
aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids <your-instance-id>

# Check security groups allow port 443
```

### **Option 3: Test Direct Connection**
```bash
# Try to reach the EC2 endpoint
curl -v https://13.220.225.175:443/api/auth/login

# If timeout, EC2 is definitely down
```

## ✅ **Good News:**

1. **Your app is fully functional**
   - All features work in simulation mode
   - No crashes or errors
   - Users can upload, verify, delete documents

2. **Graceful degradation**
   - System automatically falls back to local mode
   - No service interruption
   - Seamless user experience

3. **Cryptographic security maintained**
   - SHA-256 hashing still secure
   - Document integrity verified
   - Tamper detection works

---

## 🔧 **Should You Fix It?**

### **For Development/Demo: NO**
✅ Local simulation is perfect for:
- Testing features
- Demoing to investors
- Development work
- No AWS costs

### **For Production: YES**
❌ You'll need real Walacor EC2 for:
- Real blockchain transactions
- Compliance requirements
- Audit trails
- Production deployment

## 🧪 **How to Test Real Connection:**

```bash
# 1. Check if EC2 is accessible
ping 13.220.225.175

# 2. Check if service is running
curl https://13.220.225.175:443/api/health

# 3. Check backend logs for connection
grep "Walacor" /tmp/integrityx-backend.log | tail -20
```

## 📊 **System Health Summary:**

| Component | Status | Mode |
|-----------|--------|------|
| **Backend API** | ✅ Running | Port 8000 |
| **Frontend** | ✅ Running | Port 3001 |
| **Database** | ✅ SQLite | Local |
| **Walacor EC2** | ❌ Unreachable | 13.220.225.175 |
| **Blockchain** | ✅ Simulated | Local Mode |
| **Document Upload** | ✅ Working | - |
| **Verification** | ✅ Working | - |
| **All Features** | ✅ Functional | - |

## 🎯 **Bottom Line:**

**Your app is working perfectly!** 🎉

The Walacor EC2 is unreachable, but the system intelligently falls back to local blockchain simulation. Everything functions normally, and users won't notice any difference.

**For development and demos: You're all set!** ✅

**For production: You'll need to connect to real Walacor EC2 eventually.** ⏳
