# ✅ DASHBOARD DISPLAY OVERLAP FIXED!

## ❌ **Problem:**
API Response Time was showing: `38.650989532470796ms`
- Very long decimal number
- Overlapping with other elements
- Looked unprofessional

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

Added `Math.round()` to all performance metrics to display clean, whole numbers:

### **Before:**
```typescript
{stats.performanceMetrics.apiResponseTime}ms
// Shows: 38.650989532470796ms ❌
```

### **After:**
```typescript
{Math.round(stats.performanceMetrics.apiResponseTime)}ms
// Shows: 39ms ✅
```
