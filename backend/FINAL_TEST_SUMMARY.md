- ✅ GET `/api/deleted-documents/{original_artifact_id}`
- ✅ GET `/api/deleted-documents/loan/{loan_id}`
- ✅ POST `/api/verify-deleted-document`
- ✅ POST `/api/verify-by-hash` (updated)

### **Data Models**
- ✅ `DeletedDocument` model
- ✅ `DeleteDocumentRequest` model
- ✅ `DeleteDocumentResponse` model
- ✅ `DeletedDocumentInfo` model
- ✅ `VerifyDeletedDocumentRequest` model
- ✅ `VerifyDeletedDocumentResponse` model

### **Business Logic**
- ✅ Soft delete implementation
- ✅ Metadata preservation
- ✅ Verification capabilities
- ✅ Audit trail maintenance
- ✅ Error handling

## 🎯 Requirements Verification

### **Core Requirement: "Keep hash ID and other ID so whenever any user verify about that file we can say that it was uploaded on this time and date and it was deleted on this time and date"**

✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED**

- ✅ Hash ID preserved in `DeletedDocument` table
- ✅ Original creation date preserved
- ✅ Deletion date recorded
- ✅ User who uploaded preserved
- ✅ User who deleted recorded
- ✅ Verification provides complete timeline
- ✅ Verification message includes all required information

### **Example Verification Message:**
```
"This document was uploaded on 2025-10-22 21:30:01 and deleted on 2025-10-22 21:30:01 by integration_deleter@example.com."
```
