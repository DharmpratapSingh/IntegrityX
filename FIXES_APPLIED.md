# 🔧 Import Fixes Applied

## ❌ **Problem:**
Pages (Documents, Verification, Analytics) were inaccessible due to missing icon imports.

## ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

### 1. **Documents Page** (`frontend/app/documents/page.tsx`)
**Added missing imports:**
- `CheckCircle` - Used in hero stats card for "Success Rate"
- `TrendingUp` - Could be used for trends (imported for consistency)

### 2. **Verification Page** (`frontend/app/(private)/verification/page.tsx`)
**Added missing import:**
- `Shield` - Used in hero stats card for "Success Rate"

### 3. **Analytics Page** (`frontend/app/analytics/page.tsx`)
**No changes needed** - All imports were already present

## 🚀 **Status:**

All pages should now be accessible:
- ✅ Dashboard: `/integrated-dashboard`
- ✅ Upload: `/upload`  
- ✅ Documents: `/documents` (FIXED!)
- ✅ Verification: `/verification` (FIXED!)
- ✅ Analytics: `/analytics` (Already working)

## 📱 **Test Now:**

Visit http://localhost:3001 and navigate to each page to confirm they all load correctly!
